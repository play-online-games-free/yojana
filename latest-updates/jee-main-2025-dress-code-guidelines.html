<h1>Essential Dress Code Guidelines for JEE Main 2025 Candidates</h1>

<p>Preparing for the JEE Main 2025 is both an exciting and challenging time for aspirants. Along with dedicated preparation, following the dress code and examination rules set by the National Testing Agency (NTA) is crucial. Below are the detailed guidelines to ensure a smooth examination day experience.</p>

<h2>Opt for Simple and Comfortable Attire</h2>
<p>On the exam day, choose light and comfortable clothing. Avoid garments with multiple pockets, zippers, or metallic components as they may complicate the security check process. This will save time during frisking and ensure compliance with the rules.</p>

<h2>Avoid Full-Sleeved and Layered Clothing</h2>
<p>Stick to half-sleeved shirts, t-shirts, or kurtas. Full-sleeved or layered clothing may attract additional security checks, potentially delaying your entry to the examination hall.</p>

<h2>Refrain from Wearing Accessories</h2>
<p>Avoid metallic accessories, such as jewelry, watches, and belts. These items can trigger security alarms during the frisking process, causing unnecessary delays.</p>

<h2>Choose Appropriate Footwear</h2>
<p>Wear sandals or slippers with low heels. Closed footwear like sneakers or formal shoes may lead to extra screening. Opting for simple footwear ensures quicker entry into the hall.</p>

<h2>Headgear Restrictions</h2>
<p>Caps, hats, or any head coverings are prohibited unless worn for religious purposes. Ensure such headgear is simple and justified to avoid complications during verification.</p>

<h2>Guidelines for Female Candidates</h2>
<p>Female aspirants are advised to wear simple, comfortable clothing without elaborate designs, layers, or embroidery. Stoles, scarves, and heavy jewelry are prohibited to facilitate a smoother verification process.</p>

<h2>Prohibited Items in the Examination Hall</h2>
<p>Avoid carrying any electronic devices, notebooks, books, or written material. Leave these items at home to prevent any inconvenience or rule violations.</p>

<h2>Special Provisions for Diabetic Candidates</h2>
<p>Diabetic candidates are permitted to carry sugar tablets, fruits like bananas or oranges, and a transparent water bottle into the examination hall. These provisions ensure health management during the exam without breaking rules.</p>

<h2>Mandatory Documents to Carry</h2>
<p>Carry a printed copy of your JEE Main admit card along with valid ID proof (e.g., Aadhaar card, voter ID, or passport). These documents are essential for gaining entry to the examination center.</p>

<h2>Reporting Time and Frisking Procedures</h2>
<p>Reach the exam center well before the reporting time to complete verification and frisking procedures without rush. Latecomers are often denied entry, so plan your journey accordingly.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Adhering to these dress code guidelines ensures a hassle-free experience during JEE Main 2025. Proper attire and documentation save time, reduce stress, and help candidates focus on performing their best. Good luck to all aspirants!</p>
